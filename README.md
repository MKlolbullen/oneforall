# OneForAll - Comprehensive Bug Bounty/Penetration Testing Toolkit

### This is a WIP (Work In Progress)

OneForAll is an all-in-one penetration testing and reconnaissance framework designed to automate key tasks for bug bounty hunters and cybersecurity professionals. This toolkit consolidates subdomain enumeration, vulnerability assessment, directory fuzzing, and more into a cohesive workflow.


---

## Features

1. Subdomain Enumeration

Tools: assetfinder, subfinder, chaos-client

Automatically discovers subdomains and checks for live hosts.


2. URL Gathering

Tools: gau, urlfinder, katana, waybackpy, gospider

Collects URLs from various sources for deeper analysis.


3. Directory Fuzzing

Tool: gobuster

Identifies hidden directories on the target domain.


4. Vulnerability Scanning

Tools: sqlmap, dalfox, kxss, corsy, sniper, nuclei

Detects vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and misconfigurations.


5. Port Scanning

Tools: Nmap, Rustscan, Naabu

Comprehensive IP and port scanning for open services.


6. OSINT Gathering

Tool: Shodan API

Fetches intelligence on target IPs to reveal exposed services and metadata.


7. Reporting

Generates reports in HTML, JSON, or other formats.

Includes vulnerabilities, discovered URLs, and OSINT data.
